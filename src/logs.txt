Puzzle, Default Outcome,                                                 Error Removal
0,      Perfect
1,      Perfect
3,      Perfect
6,      Perfect (for the one sudoku it detects)
17,     Solves perfectly
18,     Solves perfectly
19,     Solves perfectly

8,      Misses some digits (2s) but solves correctly anyway
13,     Two blanks but solves
14,     One blank but solves
15,     One blank but solves


2,      Solution but missing digits so incorrect

5,      Misses a couple of digits and adds two 1s so fails to solve might be too few to solve,  makes it solveable but wrong as some digits didnt show and some were lost (test)
9,      Misses quite a few digits and had error so didnt solve, (test) makes it solvable but very slow with brute also wrong as some digits were missing
10,     Misses some digits and replaces some 7s with 1s so no sol (test), solvable but mutiple digits swapped so wrong, 

12,     Lots of blank spaces filled with 1s unsolvable, (test) technically solves but so many missing not including the false 1s that theres lots of wrong overlaps
16,     Barely picks up any digits and has errors probably never solvable but can use < 17 checking to alert system, (test) so many overlaps basically useless


20,     Puzzle is already complete in image but most digits not recognised so maybe not enough to verify solution also some dupes, (test) way too ambiguous loads of wrong coverings completely useless


7,      error: 'main_board' is not defined

4,      Fails to detect grid
11,     Doesnt find grid

98,     Completely unrecogniseable as grid not located properly
99,     Completely unrecogniseable as grid not located properly
